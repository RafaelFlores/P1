<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>
  My name is Rafael Flores Gonzalez. I am an Electric Engineer from Mexico City.
  I am a husband and a father of a one year old doughter and I am also
  a student for the Master in Liberal Arts of Software Engineering at
  Harvard Extension School.
  I work for the biggest telecuminactions company of Mexico, named TELMEX.
  I work as a project engineer looking after the instalations that contractors
  do for a big region of the city.
</p>

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>
  I am taking this course because i think that developing well structiured web
  pages and applications its an essential ability to any one that wants to have
  a carrier on technology. I also think that making not only pages but dynamic
  web applications offer a lot of posibilities to develop for little children
  like my doughter.
</p>

<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>
  I have always enjoyed technology, as a little kid I tought my self how to
  program in several languages such as Basic and Pascal, but even thow I studied
  Electrical Engineering I never had any formal training until I saw CS50 in the
  IPhone. This made me very interested in computer Science so I started working
  on the Master Degree for Software Engineering. I have taken 5 courses so far:
  CS50 Intensive Introduction to Computer Science, CS51 Abstraction and Design in
  Computation, CS55 Java for Distributed Computing, CS40 Comunication Protocols
  and CS28 Unix/Linux systems programming. This is my first course on Web
  technologys
</p>

<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>
  I am working on a Mac Mini, with OS X Yosemite. It also has Windows 8 and 10
  on parallels but I definetely prefer to work on MAC OS.
</p>

<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>
  I am looking forward to get the must I can out of this course.
